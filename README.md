# odin-space-shooter-game
A simple space shooter learning project made with Odin and Raylib.

# To compile the project you need two things:
1. The odin compiler binary folder in your environment paths (check in your terminal: <code>odin version</code>)
2. Vscode to build and run the related projects tasks
- Or build and run the game with: <code>odin run ./src -out:/export/release/SpaceShooterGame.exe</code>
